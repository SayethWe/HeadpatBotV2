QUICKSTART:
  - get a headpat (or up to four!) with `/headpat`
  - use `/waifu show [waifu]` to see an image of a waifu known to the bot
  - suggest a new waifu, or an image of an existing one, using `/waifu suggest [name] [source]` and attaching an image
  - the `/managewaifus` commands can be used to add waifus known to the bot to your server. We reccomend making this command moderator-only.
  - when you have sufficient waifus in the server, `/poll start` will create a poll for users to select which waifus they like. Once again, this is a good command to make moderator-only.
  - close an open poll with `/poll close`, and view results of past polls with `/poll results [pollNumber]`
  - view tickets earned fom poll participation with `/tickets get`
  - spend tickets to claim a random server waifu with `/gacha roll [ticketsToSpend]`
  - Use `/help [command name]` to see more information on headpatbot's capabilities`
headpat:
  - this gets you a headpat.
  - optionally, you can select a number of headpats, maximum four, to get at once.
waifu:
  - Interacts with waifus headpatbot knows of in various ways
  - To inform headpatbot of a new waifu, or an image for one already known, use `/waifu suggest`, attaching an image and specifying the waifu's name and source material.
  - Suggested waifus are subject to a manual review process, and will be announced in the development server when approved.
  - ''
  - Using `/waifu show` will present an image of a waifu known to headpatbot.
  - If the waifu has been pulled into the server, it will also show the local rating and what user, if any, has claimed that waifu.
  - ''
  - Finally, `/waifu getList` allows inspecition of what waifus are available globally, in the server, or available to pull.
manage_waifus:
  - Allows for server interactions with waifus.
  - add one waifu at a time with `/manage_waifus pull`, or multiple at once with `/manage_waifus pull_csv`. The CSV may have any number of columns, but the first two must be `name,source`
  - remove previously added waifus with `/manage_waifus remove`
  - ''
  - This is a command family that is likely best restricted to trusted members in the server integration settings
poll:
  - Waifu polls are the fundamental way to create inter-user interaction.
  - Once there are enough waifus added to a server (>15 by default), `/poll start` can be run to create a waifu poll.
  - Users can vote privately on which waifus they like, and confirm their votes.
  - When users have voted, run `/poll close` to calculate the results and update waifu ratings
  - A results graph will also be shared that can be viewed again with `/poll results`
  - polls distribute tickets to users who voted, and to those who had claimed waifus in the poll
  - ''
  - It is reccomended to use the integration settings in your server to make these commands restricted
  - ""
  - "`/jump_to_poll` will provide a link to easily get to the latest poll in the server"
gacha:
  - The way to claim a waifu for your own
  - '`/tickets get` will show how many tickets you;ve earned from poll participation'
  - spend tickets with `/gacha roll` to claim a random waifu, weighted so that waifus with ratings close to the number of tickets spent are more likely
  - see which waifus you've claimed with `/gacha collection`
  - using /gacha improve will spend tickets to increase the level of a claimed waifu
  - ''
  - waifus are automatically un-claimed and returned to the pool after a set amount of time
  - higher leveled waifus will remain claimed longer, but do eventually release as well
  - declaiming a waifu early with `/gacha remove` will refund some tickets, based on the waifu's rating, level, and how long was remaining before automatic return
  - whenever a waifu becomes unclaimed by any means, they will take a slight rating hit
options:
  - sets a server-side option
  - poll waifu count -> Number of waifus in each poll round. Between 2 and 24
  - poll waifu image vertical pixels -> vertical resolution of each waifu in a poll image. Between 100 and 800. Unused 
  - poll waifu image aspect percent -> aspect ratio (width/height) in percent of each tile in a poll image. Between 50 and 200. Unused
  - gacha collection max count -> number of waifus a member is allowed to have. Between 0 and 25
  - gacha collection expiration hours -> number of hours a level 1 waifu will stay claimed. Between 1 and 10,000
