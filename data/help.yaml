QUICKSTART:
  - getting started:
  - get a headpat with `/headpat`
  - use `/waifu show [waifu]` to see an image of a waifu known to the bot
  - suggest a new waifu, or an image of an existing one, using `/waifu suggest [name] [source]` and attaching an image
  - the `/managewaifus` commands can be used to add waifus known to the bot to your server. We reccomend making this command moderator-only.
  - when you have sufficient waifus in the server, `/poll start` will create a poll for users to select which waifus they like. Once again, this is a good command to make moderator-only.
  - close an open poll with `/poll close`, and view results of past polls with `/poll results [pollNumber]`
  - view tickets earned fom poll participation with `/tickets get`
  - spend tickets to claim a random server waifu with `/gacha roll [ticketsToSpend]`
